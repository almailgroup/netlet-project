# NetLet

Kuwait-first marketplace storefront. React + Vite client, Express + tRPC server,
Shopify for catalog and checkout, Postgres for accounts.

## Design reference

`almailgroup/netlet-old-design`, branch `claude/shiplee-tracking-website` — an
earlier vanilla HTML/CSS build of NetLet. Treat it as a source of design ideas,
not of code: it is a different stack and a different palette.

Read it for layout and treatment. Worth knowing what is in there:

- The glass is on the header _bar_, not just its controls:
  `rgba(247,246,242,0.75)` under `blur(25px) saturate(210%)`. More translucent
  and more saturated than the current header, which sits at 0.95.
- The mobile bottom bar floats with a 24px radius, an upward shadow, and
  `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` — that last part is where the current mobile
  nav's home-indicator fix came from.

**Its palette is a different direction** — yellow `#FEEE00`, blue `#1E3A8A`,
soft orange `#ffa86e`. The current brand is navy `#0a285a`, orange `#f2683a`,
pearl `#f3f2ed`. Do not carry the old colours across without asking.

## Buttons

One rule, and it is easy to break by accident. The three filled tints
(`.glass-navy`, `.glass-accent`, `.glass-on-dark`) share a construction: solid
fill, a single hairline along the top edge, a soft inner shade at the bottom, a
restrained rim. **No diagonal wash and no hover sweep** — over a filled surface
those read as glare.

The clear tint (`.glass`) keeps both, because on a near-transparent surface they
are what makes the glass legible at all.

`backdrop-filter` on an opaque fill is wasted work; only the clear tint and
`.glass-field` carry it.

## Accounts

Registered accounts live in **Firebase Authentication** — the password, and
later the reset and verification flows that come with it. `users` in Postgres
keeps one mirror row per shopper, linked by `firebase_uid`, because saved
products, delivery area, notification preferences and order tracking are all
foreign keys to its serial `id`.

The password is checked server-side, through Identity Toolkit rather than the
Firebase Web SDK, so no Firebase code ships to the client and the session stays
the same httpOnly cookie. `docs/FIREBASE.md` is the setup.

With the four `FIREBASE_*` variables unset, the same endpoints fall back to the
local scrypt digest in `password_hash`. Exactly one of the two is set on any
given account.

## Chrome

`StoreHeader` and `MobileTabBar` are the site's navigation, and every shopping
page uses both. They exist because the cart did not: a shopper could add four
things from a category page and have no way to reach the cart from it. The
drawer is mounted once in `App`, not per page, for the same reason.

Two pages deliberately opt out. Home keeps its own taller header — it carries
the department rail and the hover-to-expand behaviour, which only earn their
place on the page you land on. Checkout keeps a bare one: every extra exit on a
payment page is an invitation to take it.

`useOverlay` is what a drawer, dialog or sheet owes whoever opened it —
Escape closes, focus returns to the opener, the page behind stops scrolling.
Use it for anything modal rather than re-deriving two of the three.

`.tap-target` grows a small control's hit area to 44px through a pseudo-element,
without changing how it looks. Gallery dots are 6px on purpose; a 6px *target*
was a coin toss on a phone.

## Inventory

NetLet owns its catalog. `drizzle/schema.ts` holds vendors, vendor members,
categories, products, variants, images and stock movements, in the Supabase
Postgres that `DATABASE_URL` points at. Money is `numeric`, never a float — the
dinar has three decimal places and a binary fraction cannot hold 24.375.

**`shared/inventory/permissions.ts` is the whole access model, and it is pure.**
Two axes: *scope* (a vendor member reaches their own vendor and nothing else,
an admin reaches everything) and *rank* (`staff` moves stock, `manager` runs
the catalog, `owner` runs the team). Some capabilities no vendor rank can
reach at all — commission above all, which the requirements put outside a
vendor's control entirely.

Guards live in `server/inventory.ts`, next to the query each protects, not in
the router alone: a second caller added later would skip a router-level check
silently. `assertCan` throws `FORBIDDEN:<capability>`, which the router
translates into a 403.

There is one router for admins and vendors, not two. Two would mean the same
procedures twice with a different guard at the top of each, which is the
arrangement where a guard eventually goes missing from one copy. Every
procedure resolves *who is asking* and the data layer refuses the rest.

A vendor publishing means asking: the product goes to `pending_review` unless
their vendor carries `autoPublish`. Suspending a vendor empties their shelf
without editing a single product, which is what makes suspension a real lever.

## Browsing

`/category/:slug` is the department page — the sidebar, the grid, the sort.
Clicking a department anywhere on the site goes there; the home page is a
shopfront of curated rails, not a filtering surface, so it holds no "active
category" of its own.

`shared/commerce/browse.ts` is all of the logic and is pure: `facetsFor`
derives the filters **from the products on the page**, so a catalog of laptops
gets a Ram Size filter and one of shoes does not — nothing is hard-coded. A
facet that cannot narrow is dropped (one brand, one option value, a rating
threshold matching everything), because a control that changes nothing is worse
than no control.

**Filters live in the query string, never in state alone.** A narrowed list is
something shoppers bookmark and send each other, so the URL is the single
source of truth and the page reads back from it. Option facets are namespaced
`opt.<name>` so a merchant option called "sort" cannot collide.

Slugs are lossy on purpose — "Home & Kitchen" becomes `home-and-kitchen` — and
`categoryFromSlug` resolves them back against the live catalog rather than
trying to invert them. An unrecognised slug falls back to the whole catalog,
never to an empty page.

## Languages

The storefront ships in English and Arabic, from one dictionary in
`shared/i18n/dictionary.ts`. `ar` is typed as a complete record of the English
keys, so a missing translation is a type error rather than an English word
appearing mid-Arabic-sentence; `shared/i18n/dictionary.test.ts` also fails on an
Arabic entry that is still a copy of the English, or that has drifted from its
`{placeholder}` set.

Two rules keep the RTL layout honest:

- **No physical direction utilities in page code.** `ms-`/`me-`/`ps-`/`pe-`/
  `start-`/`end-`/`text-start`/`border-s`. `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` is the
  exception — it centres, it does not take a side. The unused shadcn primitives
  under `components/ui/` are left as they came.
- **Arrows and chevrons that mean "onward" carry `rtl:-scale-x-100`.** So do
  the gradients and masks that shade toward the text, or the Arabic headline
  ends up sitting on the bright side of the hero.

Merchant data (product titles, spec rows) is in whatever language the merchant
typed. Specification rows and description text carry `dir="auto"` so each takes
its own direction and the punctuation lands on the right side.

## Deploys

`server/_core/app.ts` holds the routes and the security, and knows nothing
about how it is served. Two entry points use it: `server/_core/index.ts` adds
Vite or static files and listens on a port, `api/index.ts` exports it as a
Vercel function. One copy of the routes, so the two cannot drift.

Vercel is the target that can run the backend — `docs/VERCEL.md` is the setup,
and environment variables live in its dashboard rather than a `.env`. The app
normalises a `/trpc/…` path back to `/api/trpc/…`, because a platform that
rewrites onto a function mounted at `/api` may hand over the rewritten path,
and every call would otherwise 404 silently.

### GitHub Pages

Pages serves `main` at `/` — "Deploy from a branch", one branch only. The
workflow builds and commits the result back into `main`, so its deploy commits
land on the branch you are working on: expect to rebase.

Two traps:

- The base path is derived from the repository name at build time. A rename
  moves the Pages URL, and a build carrying the old name loads to a blank page.
- The deploy commit carries a skip-ci marker. Do not write that marker verbatim
  in an ordinary commit message — GitHub matches it anywhere in the message and
  will skip the build.

## Demo mode

`VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` builds a version with no backend: `client/src/lib/demoLink.ts`
answers every tRPC procedure from fixtures in `demoCatalog.ts`. That is what the
Pages site runs. **The catalog is invented** — sample products and prices, with
nothing on the page saying so since the preview banner was removed.

## iOS app

`ios-app/` is the whole iOS side: the Expo source, the artwork, and the
generated Xcode project in `ios-app/ios/`, which is committed so it opens from
a clone. It is a WebView shell around the published Pages site, so it needs no
backend running.

`ios/` is generated from `app.json` by `npx expo prebuild` — hand edits to the
Xcode project are lost the next time that runs. `ios-app/README.md` has the
run steps and what is deliberately not committed.

Expo Go cannot run it: three of its modules ship native code. `npx expo run:ios`
is the way in.

## Checks

`pnpm check` · `pnpm test` · `pnpm build`. Data-layer tests run against a real
Postgres in-process via PGlite, applying the generated migration verbatim, so
`ON CONFLICT` arbiters and enum types are genuinely exercised.

Configuration lives in `.env.example`, annotated with what each value switches
off — nothing throws at boot, so a missing value shows up as a dead feature.
`pnpm setup:env` writes the `.env` from it; given the Firebase service-account
JSON it also writes the three values whose escaping is the usual failure.
`pnpm preflight` then says what is still missing, by name.
